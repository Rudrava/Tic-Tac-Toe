# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple version of tic tac toe with AI using minimax algorithm
in the setUp.py file add the resolution of screen u wanna play in 
and also the input method u want to use just turn it to True 
eg
  
  
    if u wanna play with mouse 
      MOUSE = True
  
    or if u wanna play with keyboard numpad 
      KEYBOARD = True



    Note :- the inputs for the top left box starts with numpad 1 and follows until numpad 9
          any other key input is considered to be invlid

then just run the mainGui.py file 

the game would start

Rules :- 
      are all the same as normal TIC TAC TOE

    no duplicate entries 
    subsequent similar entries along row, column or diagonals win !!!
    
ENJOY!!!
